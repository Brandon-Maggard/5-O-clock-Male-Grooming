                    <h2>Our Shop</h2>
                    <p>After working year in the industry and working for other shop owners, Rhonda McNair decided to branch off and take a chance on her dream instead of playing a part in someone else's.  In 2017, Rhonda decided to open her own barber shop, and is where 5 O'clock Male Grooming was created.  She started small in a shop next to the Sikes Center Mall and had two other barbers to help her set the fondation.  Her vision was to create an old-school feel and bring the art of barbering back in the forefront; however, with some modern services included.  She created a relaxing environment where you can get a classic but modern cut, while also getting pampered and having a cold one while it happens.  Just a few years after opening, her daughter Taylor also joined the team to follow in her motherâ€™s footstep.  In late 2021, after outgrowing the location she started at, she moved the shop off of Old Jacksboro Highway, and is continuing the vision she initially set out with.  </p>
