# 5-O-clock-Male-Grooming
Website that was made for a local barber shop.  

5 Oâ€™clock Male Grooming currently did not have a website for their business. This was a huge problem, mainly because a business without a website makes people question if they are a legitimate business. The one thing that they did have going was they did have a way, through a third-party site, to make appointments. The approach for this business was to create a responsive website, so that people visiting the site would know that they are a legitimate business and to find out what services they provided and using their existing way of creating an appointment online.
